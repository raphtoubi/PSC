# Determination of heart rate from a video

First, we selecte skin pixels on the picture thanks to SkinDetector

Then we analyze their differences in color induced by the blood flow to the face so as to infer the heart rate with Pywavelet

The project was carried out in collaboration with Datakalab, a startup specialized in neuro marketing that uses Computer Vision to detect emotions.
